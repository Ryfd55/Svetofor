The very beginning of learning Android Studio.
Studied pressing buttons using the setOnSlickListener method, random and resources.


How the app work:

When you click on the button with the name of the color, the background changes to the corresponding color.
When you click on the "Красный" button, the names of all buttons change to names from the list.
